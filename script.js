        "The first week was really stressful for me as the choices I make this week will decide the fate of this module. From choosing the challenge to teammates, it made me more skeptical about the process. However, I will still try my best and cope with whatever is given ahead. I have heard that there is a chance for all students to be able to have their internship in OCBC, therefore having a lingering thought of joining a ocbc challenge as I thought I will stand a higher chance. I was later than everyone else, where there are many people who already took all the slots for all ocbc challenges. It left me no choice but to go for either workato challenge statement or Ngee Ann polytechnic statement. After not much thought, I have decided to go for the “sustainability in Ngee Ann Polytechnic” challenge statement, as my friends were there. It turned out fine as my tutor is also my mentor, Dr Joel. Although that was a good sign, I felt that this challenge statement was a bit hard to implement. After Dr Joel went through the challenge topic, he told the class that all classes stand an equal chance of going intern in ocbc. I felt overjoyed when I heard that and was motivated to do my best. However, the worst is yet to come. The teaming was almost random where everyone was to write an idea to implement this challenge statement. Out of the entire class, all my friends were the top few posts and hence were chosen as team leaders. It felt surreal, how can all my friends (Hong Wei) be so stupid?? This means that we cannot be in the same team anymore. Although this set back, I wasn't that disappointed as the teammates I have gotten does not seem too bad. I ended up picking Chun kai, Daniel and Chen han. It seems alright as I noticed that we were the only group which interacted quite well with each other. I told my group to think about ideas for a solution for the challenge statement. Only I spoke out about an idea and the team was just going with the flow without a second thought. It felt frustrating but I understand because it's the first lesson of school. Overall, week 1 was quite hectic and stress inducing. :D ",

        "The second week was deciding and finalizing our idea. During the long weekend, I asked my group to research and write down their thoughts about sustainability. After that, come up with an idea that may work based on their understanding. I came up with an idea which focuses on business with sustainability, where people would donate items and we would sell/give back to the community using various technologies like websites or mobile applications. Everyone did the research and gave an idea which is fantastic. We also consulted Dr Joel for further advice on improving our ideas. After all this, I can see that my team is bonding well together unlike the other teams which puts my heart at ease seeing that we at least have some chemistry between us. I had also made figma files for us to do the user story planning and wireframe. By the looks of it, I should go well if everyone does their work. I started by asking what application we are using to code the solution. Firstly, we thought of using MVC framework to code the application. However, I wanted to use firebase database instead of MS SQL. I had tried integrating firebase into the mvc framework but it is very tough as it is not supported and mvc is not very popular. Therefore, I had decided to use HTML/CSS and javascript for my website. FIrstly, it has more freedom as I get to design and develop anything I want whereas MVC is too structured and has no freedom for crazy UI designs or features. Although my teammates were not too confident in HTML/CSS and javascript coding, I encouraged them that it would not be that hard. Week 2 was the start point for the coding and the endeavor awaits.",

        "The third week was the start of coding the application. I have a strong feeling that I need to hard carry as my team has 2 weak coders and only left me and chunkai. Chun kai also seems to retaliate by learning new things, in this case coding in a HTML website. We have been through this in ID, so I am not really sure why. I have no choice but to do everything myself because I am a kan chiong spider. I want to complete as much code as possible so that the hackathon will not be so stressful. My team was not proactive as they would not do any work unless I told them to. This is extremely tiring to keep telling them what to do as it is hard to make a work schedule for each individual member. Nonetheless, I had tasked my teammates with work to do based on their strengths where, chen han will be doing a UI path, chun kai will be helping me with some UI and backend and Daniel will do the entire slides and pitch for the team.  We also visited the dev ops center in NP. It was pretty cool as I have never seen anything like this in real life before. The room also has a funky smell… ",

      testimonial:
        "The fourth week I am starting to feel very stressed.  The technical part is doing well, however, I began to further doubt the idea and needed to start all over into ideation.  The problem is that the idea has a flaw where the donors do get any gains from donating which would promote donating. Hence, I gather the team to start ideating about that problem. As more ideas get poured in by my teammates and teacher, I get extremely confused and lost as I do not know what is best to do. I asked myself whether it is feasible and realistic. I am still very confused and do not know how to continue. To make it worse, next week is the submission dateline alongside with a lot of work from whitespace week and week 4. It is going to hell week and I am not sure if my team is able to pull through with everything in place. Right now, I will just stick to finishing up the basic frame of the website and continue to prototype with the idea given to us. ",

        "This was the final stretch, the hackathon was the finale of assignment 1 and also no more PFD lessons for the remaining term. I was excited and stressed at the same time, wanting it to all end so that I can focus on other work in the future. I have worked tirelessly since week 2 to code the application from start to finish based on what I had planned. Although not all of the functions were implemented, it was still as good as finished. My teammates also helped do other side hustles like slides, pitching, marketing for the website e.g email and instagram account and error handling plus coding. Everyone came together to give the final push. It turned out to be a huge success as the pitching/demo went well as well as winning the best project for our challenge topic “what does sustainability look like in Ngee Ann Polytechnic?”. We also got prizes for getting first. I received a razer mouse and a toblerone. It was also my first hackathon and I am really proud of the outcome. ",

        "This was the start of the second term and the requirement for assignment 2 is to improve on our application and make drastic changes to it. As most of the features that I want to implement were completed in assignment 1. There were little things to implement based on the plan we had on assignment 1. Hence, I had decided to take a twist to the website where I will be gamifying this application. Users can get points via claiming or posting products into the website. There will be achievements that users can achieve by doing some requirements. There will also be a leaderboard to tell users where they are standing. The leaderboard can also act as a way to motivate users to participate in this e-waste donating platform. Another feature that is planned to be done was the chat feature that was planned last assignment. Instead of using an external source for messaging (telegram), we will use the one in the website for communications. Lastly, I will be improving on the overall UI of the website as it was too plain and minimalist. I assigned Chun Kai to do the chat implementation while I will gamify and improve the UI on the website. Daniel will be asked to do slides again and Chen Han is to do a UI path for the leaderboard. That was the plan for assignment 2 and it was own time own target base as this term is going to be stressful where all our modules will have assignments/tests. I will start off by doing the game details as well as UI in figma, where the plan and wireframe will be done there.",

        "This week, I will be starting work by finalizing work to be done on figma. For the UI, I was not that strong in that area as I only have experience in minimalistic designing. Therefore, I asked a good friend of mine for some inspiration for the website UI to not make it look so boring. Together, we worked and researched about the different UI they are and made the figma wireframe together. It ended up looking much better but I know it will be challenging to code out. For the plan, I wrote down the scoring system as well as defining how a request is processed from posting to claiming a product. Everything needs a rework as everything we now be connected to each other. After the planning and wireframe was finished, I started to implement the improvement on the website. For this week, I will just be focusing on remaking the UI for all the pages. I finished the home page, store page, and half way for the user home page. Next week, I will be focusing on the user home page for both front and backend. With all the work piling up from all my modules, I was getting a bit stressed as I was afraid that I could not finish the work. With the upcoming chinese new year visiting, it was also not helping with my stress. Hence, I decided to start work early. ",

        "This week was Chinese new year visiting as well as other  assignments to hand up and it has affected my time to do work. . However, I have managed to continue working on the user home page with the UI changes as well as achievements on the front-end. I had a bump when I realized that my UI for my store has a user profile picture. So, I needed to implement something that can allow users to have profile pictures. I had also made a google login as I thought it was cool. The javascript code was a mess with functions everywhere without comments. I had to read and go through every function to know what it does. Through my determination, I had implemented a user profile picture change as well as a rough idea on how the achievement back-end will be made. With SEG and ML assignments due this week, this week was pretty hectic. I had not caught up with my team as we are all equally busy. I have decided to trust they will do their work and ignore the negative thoughts.",

        "This week was the final week before submission for both PFD and DSA, stress levels are off the roof. My team actually did their work and I also managed to finish up the backend of achievements, the leaderboard and the final page, the donation form with validation. With everything integrated, I was debugging the entire website testing for errors and bugs. Unfortunately, there were a few regarding the chat and UI bugs which had been quickly fixed. The slides were also finishing up where the entire team helped and checked if anything was missed out. We proceed to do a contribution document to let Dr Joel know what each team member did. There was a last minute addition of  a FAQ feature where Chen han had made a few FAQ questions for the website. Daniel helped to write a description of the website which I will be using for the readme in github. I also cleaned up the contents in figma to hand it up as part of the assignment. Chen han has updated the social media as well as the UI path for the leaderboard. Everything was completed and now all we have left to do is submit and present it next week. I felt relieved and happy that the improvements I planned had all been implemented and was not expecting it. With all the work done, I am happy to present to Dr Joel on all the improvements that have been implemented.  ",

        "This week was the end of PFD, the final thing to do before this module ends, presenting our final product. The presentation flow was planned out in our telegram group chat. We were ready to present. Firstly, Daniel will be going through all the slides and recapping on our application as well as the UI changes. Next, it will be the demo by me, Chun kai and Chen han. We will be presenting about the features we did. During the presentation, I felt that it was quite boring as I had seen my website more than 100 times, but Dr Joel was impressed with the UI changes. We also showed where all the items were stored in the firebase database. The new request process was also demonstrated to Dr Joel, where it makes more sense now compared to during assignment 1. Overall, Dr Joel seemed impressed about the improvements and was happy about the effort put into the website. That appraisal was satisfying to hear as throughout coding this website, I had no comments on it besides Dr Joel. So it was rewarding in a sense. I felt super happy after the presentation as PFD module is now completed. Throughout this journey of ups and downs, I had learnt a few things: Never give up, no matter what happens, I learnt to bounce back and continue coding no matter how tired I am. Trust you teammates, without the trust of my teammates, I would have kept on nagging and would be quite annoying. Leadership skills, as the group leader, I need to adapt and become a leader to guide my team. Overall, PFD module was a great experience as I had fun coding without restrictions. I hope there will be more opportunities like this in the future.",
